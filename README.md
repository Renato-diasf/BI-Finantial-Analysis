# Interactive Financial Analysis with Power BI

## Project Description

This Business Intelligence project was developed using **Power BI** to analyze the financial performance of an organization over a three-year period (2019–2022). The analysis aims to provide a clear and strategic view of **revenues, expenses, and profit margins**, with interactive segmentations to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

- Evaluate **total revenue, total expenses, and profit margin** for the analyzed period  
- Identify **top revenue-generating components**, such as sales, licensing, and advertising  
- Compare **average values by expense component**, including technology, marketing, and security  
- Detect **segments with above-average values** using Power BI's automated segment analysis

## Features and Functionality

- Key indicators (KPIs) for Revenue, Expenses, and Profit Margin  
- Bar charts comparing **revenue by component**  
- Line chart showing **average value by expense type**  
- Annual summary table (2019–2022) with aggregated totals  
- Interactive segmentation highlighting **above-average behavior**  
- Responsive interface with **filters and drill-downs**

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** – dashboard creation and data modeling  
- **Power Query** – data transformation and cleaning  
- **DAX** – calculation of custom metrics (profit margin, averages, totals)
